# Strategy Selection
# Options: mean_reversion, sma_crossover
STRATEGY=mean_reversion

# ==========================================
# SMA Crossover Strategy Parameters
# ==========================================
# (Only used if STRATEGY=sma_crossover or adaptive bot selects it)

# SMA Periods - CRITICAL for profitability
# OPTIMIZED: Balanced for quality signals and faster startup
# 50/120 provides good signal quality with faster data collection (4 min vs 11 min)
# Lower values = more trades but more false signals and fees
# Higher values = fewer trades but higher quality signals
FAST_SMA_PERIOD=50   # Fast moving average (was 20, then 10)
SLOW_SMA_PERIOD=120  # Slow moving average (was 200, optimized for startup speed)

# Minimum hold time (seconds) to prevent whipsaw trades
# Prevents rapid buy-sell cycles that only generate fees
# 300 = 5 minutes, 600 = 10 minutes, 1800 = 30 minutes
MIN_HOLD_TIME=900

# Minimum profit target (as decimal) before strategies will allow exits
# With taker fees ~0.26%/side on Kraken, round-trip fees are ~0.52%
# Setting this to ~1.0%+ helps avoid "winning gross / losing net" trades
MIN_PROFIT_TARGET=0.010

# Trend alignment filter - prevent counter-trend trading
# When enabled, won't go long in downtrends or short in uptrends
# CRITICAL: Prevents 71% of losing trades (from analysis)
ENABLE_TREND_FILTER=true

# ==========================================
# Mean Reversion Strategy Parameters
# ==========================================
# (Only used if STRATEGY=mean_reversion)

# RSI Settings
# OPTIMIZED: More aggressive thresholds for crypto volatility
# Traditional: 30/70, Conservative: 40/60, Aggressive: 35/65
# Crypto markets are more volatile, so 35/65 catches more opportunities
RSI_PERIOD=14
RSI_OVERSOLD=35      # Lowered from 40 for more buy signals
RSI_OVERBOUGHT=65    # Raised from 60 for more sell signals

# ==========================================
# Fibonacci Analysis Settings
# ==========================================

# Enable/disable Fibonacci retracement and extension analysis
# Fibonacci levels help identify high-probability support/resistance and profit targets
USE_FIBONACCI=true

# Lookback period for finding swing highs/lows (default: 50 candles)
# Longer period = more stable levels, shorter = more responsive to recent price action
FIB_LOOKBACK_PERIOD=50

# Tolerance for "near Fibonacci level" detection (percentage)
# Example: 1.0 = price must be within 1% of a Fibonacci level to trigger bonus
# Used in Mean Reversion strategy to boost signal confidence
FIB_TOLERANCE=1.0

# How Fibonacci Works in Your Bot:
#
# MEAN REVERSION STRATEGY:
# - Calculates Fibonacci retracement levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%)
# - When price is near key levels (especially 61.8% "golden ratio"), signal confidence increases
# - Allows slightly relaxed RSI thresholds when at Fibonacci levels (higher accuracy)
# - Example: Buy signal at 61.8% level with RSI 42 instead of requiring RSI < 40
#
# BREAKOUT STRATEGY:
# - Calculates Fibonacci extension levels (127.2%, 161.8%, 200%, 261.8%)
# - Uses extensions as profit targets after breakout confirmed
# - 161.8% (golden ratio extension) is primary profit target
# - Logs targets automatically when breakout detected
#
# KEY FIBONACCI LEVELS EXPLAINED:
# - 38.2%: Shallow retracement (weak pullback in strong trend)
# - 50.0%: Psychological midpoint (not a Fibonacci number but widely used)
# - 61.8%: GOLDEN RATIO - strongest retracement level, highest probability
# - 127.2%: First extension target for breakouts
# - 161.8%: Golden ratio extension - primary breakout profit target
#
# RECOMMENDATIONS:
# - Keep USE_FIBONACCI=true for BTC, ETH (they respect Fib levels strongly)
# - Use FIB_LOOKBACK_PERIOD=50 for swing trading, 30 for day trading
# - FIB_TOLERANCE=1.0 is balanced; use 0.5 for strict, 2.0 for loose matching
